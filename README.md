# vegawidget

The goal of vegawidget is to render Vega-Lite and Vega specifications as
htmlwidgets, and to provide you a means to communicate with a Vega chart
using JavaScript or Shiny. Its ambition is to be a *low-level* interface
to the Vega(-Lite) API, such that other packages can build upon it to
offer higher-level functions to compose Vega(-Lite) specifications.

This is the key difference with the
[**vegalite**](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/vegalite) package: it
provides a set of higher-level functions to compose specifications,
whereas **vegawidget** concerns itself mainly with the rendering of the
htmlwidget.

To be clear, although Vega-Lite offers a grammar-of-graphics, this
package does not offer a user-friendly framework to compose graphics,
like those provided by **[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)** or
**[ggvis](https://ggvis.rstudio.com)**. However, this package may be
useful to:

-   build re-usable Vega and Vega-Lite specifications for deployment
    elsewhere, if you can tolerate the frustration of building
    specifications using lists.
-   develop higher-level, user-friendly packages to build specific types
    of plots, or even to build a general ggplot2-like framework, using
    this package as a foundation (or inspiration).

## Features

### New to vegawidget 0.3

-   vegawidget offers Vega-Lite 4.0.2 and Vega 5.9.0. Consequently, this
    package works only with browsers that support ES6. This includes all
    modern browsers and the 1.2 version of the RStudio IDE.

### New to vegawidget 0.2

-   When knitting to a non-HTML format, e.g. `github_document`, this
    package provides a `knit_print()` function that will intercept the
    normal renderer, using instead its own renderer, allowing you to
    specify `"png"` , `"svg"` or `"pdf"`. It requires that
    [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) be installed on your system, as well as
    the R packages [rsvg](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rsvg) and
    [png](https://cran.r-project.org/package=png). MacOS users will
    require an X11 system, such as [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org),
    to be installed.

    For an example, see the GitHub rendering of this [README
    file](https://github.com/vegawidget/vegawidget/blob/master/README.md).
    For more details, please see the [Render Using Vegawidget
    article](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegawidget/articles/articles/render-vegawidget.html#knitting-strategies).

-   For interactive applications, there are now functions to support
    vega-view’s
    [`addDataListener()`](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/#view_addDataListener)
    function:
    [`vw_add_data_listener()`](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegawidget/reference/add-listeners.html),
    and
    [`vw_shiny_get_data()`](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegawidget/reference/shiny-getters.html).

## Installation

You can install vegawidget from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("vegawidget")
```

The development version of vegawidget is available from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vegawidget/vegawidget")
```

**Note:** There are documentation websites for both the [CRAN
version](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegawidget) and the [development
version](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegawidget/dev) of this package.

## Introduction

Vega(-Lite) specifications are just text, formatted as JSON. However, in
R, we can use lists to build specifications:

``` r
library("vegawidget")

spec_mtcars <-
  list(
    `$schema` = vega_schema(), # specifies Vega-Lite
    description = "An mtcars example.",
    data = list(values = mtcars),
    mark = "point",
    encoding = list(
      x = list(field = "wt", type = "quantitative"),
      y = list(field = "mpg", type = "quantitative"),
      color = list(field = "cyl", type = "nominal")
    )
  ) %>% 
  as_vegaspec()
```

The `as_vegaspec()` function is used to turn the list into a *vegaspec*;
many of this package’s functions are built to support, and render,
vegaspecs:

``` r
spec_mtcars
```

The rendering of the chart above depends on where you are reading it:

-   On this package’s [pkgdown
    site](https://vegawidget.github.io/vegawidget), it is rendered as
    part of an HTML environment, showing its full capabilities.

-   At its [GitHub code site](https://github.com/vegawidget/vegawidget),
    the chart is further rendered to a static SVG file, then
    incorporated into the Markdown rendering.
