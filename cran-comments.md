## vegawidget 0.2.1

Pursuant to Uwe's emails at release of 0.1.0 (January 2019):

* In DESCRIPTION, I have enclosed software names in single-quotes.

* Most of the examples are run; the examples that \dontrun{} show specialized 
  capabilities. There are two reasons for not running examples:

  - requires nodejs to be installed
  - requires network-access

  At the the top of each \dontrun{} block, I have noted the specific reason.
